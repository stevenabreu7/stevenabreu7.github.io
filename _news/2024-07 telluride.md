Spent two weeks at Telluride in the [Language and Thought topic](https://sites.google.com/view/telluride-2024/topic-areas-2024/lt24-language-and-thought) area, presented our work on quantized SSMs at [ICML](https://icml.cc) in Vienna, and our neuromorphic programming paper at [ICONS](https://iconsneuromorphic.cc/) in Virginia!
