I am a PhD student at the AI department of the University of Groningen, working in the [MINDS](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/) group under the supervision of [Prof. Herbert Jaeger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0uztVbMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and co-supervision of [Prof. Elisabetta Chicca](https://www.rug.nl/research/zernike/bio-inspired-circuits-and-systems/chicca-group/?lang=en). I am part of the [CogniGron](https://www.rug.nl/research/fse/cognitive-systems-and-materials/?lang=en) research center for cognitive computing and funded by the European project [Post-Digital](http://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk).

In research, I like to keep one foot in **machine learning**, and the other in **novel computing paradigms and hardware** for AI. The future (and present) holds more diverse and specialized computer architectures and devices!

<!-- hardware-aware AI -->
During my PhD I develop **programming methods for novel AI hardware**, such as neuromorphic chips, event-based cameras, "cognitive materials", or photonic devices. The goal is to align computation with the underlying hardware and physics, and program despite challenges like device mismatch and limited observability. 
<!-- I am inspired by probabilistic programming and neurosymbolic programming. -->

<!-- efficient AI -->
Within ML, I am interested in **continual learning** (especially using local plasticity), **efficient AI**, and **neurosymbolic programming**.
I'm also interested in mechanistic interpretability and reverse engineering of ML models.
<!-- meta-learning, AutoML, model compression -->

<!-- OLD (2021/2022) -->
<!-- I am interested in interdisciplinary research in and around computer science and artificial intelligence: nature-inspired computing, understanding human cognition, and advancing artificial intelligence. -->
<!-- My PhD is on non-digital computing theory in the [MINDS](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/) research group and the CogniGron research center, funded by the European [Post-Digital](http://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk) research network. -->
<!-- I am developing concepts and methods for programming and interfacing with unconventional computers. I am working with analog neuromorphic hardware (spikes!), photonic computing systems, and other physical systems that can compute and/or learn. -->

I am also a hobby photographer, an enthusiastic coffee brewer, an avid motorcyclist, I like to read, travel, and go to music and art events.

## student supervision
I am available to supervise bachelor and master projects at RUG. Please send me an [email](mailto:s.abreu@rug.nl) if you are interested in working on a project related to the following topics:
- continual lifelong learning using local learning rules on neuromorphic hardware (Intel Loihi 2)
- interpretability and reverse-engineering of transformers or vision transformers
- using an event-based camera with a neuromorphic processor (*e.g.*, for robotics)
- automated machine learning or meta-learning (learning how to learn) using neural networks
- finding modular components in recurrent neural network architectures (e.g. through evolution)

<!-- Topic ideas that I would find particularly interesting:  -->
<!-- - learning in neural networks using local learning rules for bio-plausibility and efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware (e.g. equilibrium propagation). -->
<!-- - exploring different local learning rules in recurrent neural networks. -->
<!-- - autonomous multi-task learning for recurrent neural networks (e.g. using conceptors). -->
<!-- - neurosymbolic programming for neuromorphic hardware: merging machine learning with "classical" programming. -->

Take a look at [our group's website](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/) for more information on the kind of research we do, and [this page](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/teaching/studentprojects/) for more information on doing your thesis project in our group.
