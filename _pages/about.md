I am interested in interdisciplinary research in and around computer science and artificial intelligence: nature-inspired computing, understanding human cognition, and advancing artificial intelligence.

My PhD is on non-digital computing theory in the [MINDS](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/) research group and the CogniGron research center, funded by the European [Post-Digital](http://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk) research network.
I am developing concepts and methods for programming and interfacing with unconventional computers. I am working with analog neuromorphic hardware (spikes!), photonic computing systems, and other physical systems that can compute and/or learn.

In my free time I am a hobby photographer, like to read, travel, and go to music and art events.

<!-- ## meeting requests

To schedule a meeting, please use [this page](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2rU1Lj1enWIUHfiUYBFg-ZCOWu4CIIrLuWZ8_etiYXOX-10c52sYEM8Ce9BL7Zp7vDirMTnS5e) to book a time in my calendar. -->

## supervision (bachelor/master)
I am available to supervise bachelor and master projects at RUG in fall 2022.
If you are interested in working on a project related to machine learning or neural networks in novel neuromorphic hardware systems, please send me an [email](mailto:s.abreu@rug.nl).

<!-- Topic ideas that I would find particularly interesting:  -->
<!-- - learning in neural networks using local learning rules for bio-plausibility and efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware (e.g. equilibrium propagation). -->
<!-- - evolving modular components in recurrent neural network architectures. -->
<!-- - exploring different local learning rules in recurrent neural networks. -->
<!-- - autonomous multi-task learning for recurrent neural networks (e.g. using conceptors). -->
<!-- - neurosymbolic programming for neuromorphic hardware: merging machine learning with "classical" programming. -->
<!-- - automated machine learning using neural networks. -->

Take a look at [our group's website](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/) for more information on the kind of research we do, and [this page](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/teaching/studentprojects/) for more information on doing your thesis project in our group.
