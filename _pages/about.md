I am a PhD student at the AI department of the University of Groningen, working in the [MINDS](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/) group under the supervision of [Prof. Herbert Jaeger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0uztVbMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and co-supervision of [Prof. Elisabetta Chicca](https://www.rug.nl/research/zernike/bio-inspired-circuits-and-systems/chicca-group/?lang=en). I am part of the [CogniGron](https://www.rug.nl/research/fse/cognitive-systems-and-materials/?lang=en) research center for cognitive computing and funded by the European project [Post-Digital](http://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk).

In research I keep a dual focus on **advancing machine learning** while delving into **novel compute paradigms and hardware for AI**, especially those taking inspiration from the brain. I enjoy cross-disciplinary research between AI, computer science, neuroscience, physics, and cognitive science.

<!-- TODO:
- mention theoretical, mathematical, dynamical systems perspective -->

<!-- efficient AI -->
Within ML, I work on **efficient machine learning** (enabling AI on low-power hardware) and I am interested in  continual learning (e.g. using brain-inspired neuromodulation or plasticity rules), meta-learning, and neurosymbolic programming.
<!-- automated machine learning (AutoML), self-supervised learning, real-time ML, representation learning, dynamical systems for ML -->
To make progress towards well-aligned and interpretable AI, I work on **mechanistic interpretability** and reverse-engineering of ML models.

<!-- hardware-aware AI (-> more exotic stuff like photonic / analog neuromorphic) -->
For my PhD I work on **physical and brain-inspired computing**, where I aim to develop theories that align computation with physics, in order to make better use of neuromorphic chips, photonic devices, and other physical computing systems.
I aim to develop **computational abstractions in physical substrates** (e.g. through the neuromorphic intermediate representation, [NIR](https://github.com/neuromorphs/NIR)), new **hardware-compatible efficient learning algorithms**, and principled ways of ***programming* novel AI hardware** (confronting challenges like device mismatch and limited observability).
<!-- - neurosymbolic programming for neuromorphic hardware: merging machine learning with "classical" programming. -->

<!-- OLD (2021/2022) -->
<!-- I am interested in interdisciplinary research in and around computer science and artificial intelligence: nature-inspired computing, understanding human cognition, and advancing artificial intelligence. -->
<!-- My PhD is on non-digital computing theory in the [MINDS](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/) research group and the CogniGron research center, funded by the European [Post-Digital](http://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk) research network. -->
<!-- I am developing concepts and methods for programming and interfacing with unconventional computers. I am working with analog neuromorphic hardware (spikes!), photonic computing systems, and other physical systems that can compute and/or learn. -->

I am also a hobby photographer, an enthusiastic coffee brewer, an avid motorcyclist, I like to read, travel, and go to music and art events.

## student supervision
I am available to supervise bachelor and master projects at RUG. Please send me an [email](mailto:s.abreu@rug.nl) if you are interested in working on a project related to the following topics:

- efficient ML: minimizing energy and/or latency in ML models. 
- large recurrent neural networks: e.g. using state-space models (S4, LRU)
- interpretability of (multimodal) LLMs, e.g. using [conceptors](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/research/conceptorresearch/)
- continual lifelong learning on neuromorphic hardware (e.g. with plasticity rules).
- automated machine learning or meta-learning (learning how to learn) in neural networks
- investigating modularity in neural networks (e.g. in evolved RNNs)
- brain-inspired local learning rules for efficient hardware-compatible learning (e.g. equilibrium propagation, 3-factor learning, differential plasticity, evolving plasticity rules).

Take a look at [our group's website](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/) for more information on the kind of research we do, and [this page](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/teaching/studentprojects/) for more information on doing your thesis project in our group.
